ðŸª‘ 3D Furniture Modeling Project â€“ Java

This project is a collaborative 3D rendering application built in Java, where six team members worked together to model and display various types of furniture objects such as chairs, tables, and stools. The primary goal is to simulate a virtual 3D environment with basic user interaction and furniture placement.
